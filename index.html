				<h3>the extinction of the saber tooth tiger</h3>
				<p>Saber-toothed cats, American lions, woolly mammoths and other giant creatures once roamed across the American landscape. However, at the end of the late Pleistocene about 12,000 years ago, these "megafauna" went extinct, a die-off called the Quaternary extinction. Some people think they were extinct cause the ice age but that not the case.</p>
